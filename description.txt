Our project analyzes U.S. Census demographics data to deliver targeted advice for small businesses looking to expand.

The owner simply writes a paragraph describing their business, and enters the existing location(s).  Using machine learning techniques (for now, we use singular value decomposition) the back-end determines the regions within Delaware that is most similar to the location where the business has proven itself to be successful.  It then uses natural language processing to order the viable regions according to the owner's specific circumstances.

The result is a list of 10 neighborhood-sized regions (corresponding to U.S. Census Bureau tracts), which the owner can then explore further.
